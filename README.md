# AI Chatbot Web Application

Welcome to the AI Chatbot web application repository! This project demonstrates an interactive web-based chat interface that allows users to communicate with an AI model. The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the backend is powered by Flask and integrates with the OpenAI API.

## Motive

The primary goal of this project is to provide an accessible and user-friendly platform for anyone to experience the capabilities of AI-powered chatbots. By creating an intuitive chat interface, we aim to showcase the potential of AI in natural language processing and conversation generation. We believe that this project serves as an educational tool for developers, students, and enthusiasts interested in understanding how AI can be integrated into web applications.

## Features

- User-friendly chat interface for interacting with an AI model.
- Real-time display of conversations between the user and the AI.
- Stylish design with customizable message styling.
